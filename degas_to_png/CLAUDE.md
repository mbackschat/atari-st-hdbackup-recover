# Atari ST Degas PI1/PI2/PI3 Image to PNG conversion


Write a python script to convert Atari ST Degas PI1/PI2/PI3 Images to PNG images.
The script should take a folder name, where the Degas image files are.
The script will convert these files and place to generated PNG images in the same folder using the same filename, but .PNG extension.

The specification @Images.md contains details about the Atari ST Degas PI1/PI2/PI3 Image formats.
However, you can also assume that the image files already have the correct filename extensions.

Use @Images.md  and @PLAN.md. The PLAN.md captures the implementation knowledge.
